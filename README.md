# Space_Renegades
An A.I. driven toolkit for anomaly detection and classification for general purpose space missions.

## Purpose

This project is intended to provide a modeling language for abstracting the critical components of a spacecraft and generating possibie failure modes for a given anomaly during its mission span. 

## Application
A tool for mission design engineers to formulate mitigation plans in the event such anomalies are detected and identified as a possible failure mode
