# Space_Renegades
An A.I. based modeling language, anomaly detection, and classification system for in-orbit spacecrafts

## Purpose

This project is intended to provide a modeling language for abstracting the critical components of an in-orbit spacecraft and generating possibie failure modes for a given anomaly during its mission span. 

## Application
A tool for mission design engineers to formulate mitigation plans in the event such anomalies are detected and identified
