# Space_Renegades
An A.I. assisted toolkit for anomaly detection and identifying potential points of system malfunction for general purpose space mission analysis and design.

## Purpose

This project is intended to provide a modeling language for abstracting a spacecraft's system architecture and mission profile for generating possibie sequence of events at risk of system malfunction and improving anomaly detection. 

## Application
A tool for mission design engineers to formulate mitigation plans in the event such failures and identifying the probability of an anomaly as a possible failure mode.
